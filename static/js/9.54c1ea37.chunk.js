I have graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Digital Arts 3D Animation from Pratt Institute in 2018. I have completed and received two full-stack coding bootcamp certificates from the University of California Irvine (UCI 2018) and the Rithm School based in San Francisco (2019).\n\n# Currently\n\nI am continuing my studies in software engineering in hopes of transitioning this passion into a professional environment with like-minded and driven individuals.\n\n# Some history\n\n- I've been introduced to technology at an early age and have been immersed in this field for as long as I can remember. It all started off with a few video games, all of which then paved my way into the Digital Realm. This led me towards exploring 3D Animation and eventually software engineering.\n\n# I enjoy\n\n- Coding\n- Design\n- Music\n- Piano\n- Jazz and Classical Music\n- Fitness\n- Tennis\n- Animals\n\n# Timeline\n\n- I was born in Los Angeles but raised mostly in Orange County for 18 years.\n- In 2014 I graduated high school and enrolled in Pratt Institute based in Brooklyn, New York until 2018.\n- I spent 2018 attending a full-stack coding bootcamp at the University of California, Irvine.\n- In 2019 I had moved up to San Francisco and attended a full-stack coding bootcamp at the Rithm School.\n- I spent the latter half of 2019 attending an engineering internship and worked on a mobile application called My Home Pathway which utilized React Native.\n",d=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(n){return n.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(n){return n.length})).length,h=function(n){var e=Object.assign({},n);return Object(l.jsx)(a.b,Object(i.a)({},e))};e.default=function(){return Object(l.jsx)(r.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Jonathan Song",children:Object(l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(l.jsx)("header",{children:Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(l.jsx)(a.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(l.jsx)(s.a,{source:c,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
