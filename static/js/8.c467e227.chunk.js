I have graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Digital Arts 3D Animation from Pratt Institute in 2018. I have completed and received two full-stack coding bootcamp certificates from the University of California Irvine (UCI 2018) and the Rithm School based in San Francisco (2019).\n\n# Currently\n\nI am continuing my studies in software engineering in hopes of transitioning this passion into a professional environment with like-minded and driven individuals collaborating in projects of greater scale.\n\n# Some history\n\n- I've been introduced to technology at an early age and have been immersed in this field for as long as I can remember. It all started of with some video games like World of Warcraft, Counter-Strike, Starcraft, Diablo... etc. All of which paved my interests into the Digital Realm. Aside from a strong passion in gaming, this led me to explore visual design and eventually software engineering.\n\n\n- A huge piece of my identity lies in competitive gaming. I've always held high standards in competition and have even taken time to pursue professional esports. While I have recently transitioned my focus towards ranking up in coding, I have several merits within gaming that showcase my time and dedication to the craft:\n\n\n  - ROCKET LEAGUE ~ Grand Champ 1 (0.10%) of players in North America (2020)\n  - VALORANT ~ Immortal 2 (0.4%) of players in North America (2019)\n  - OVERWATCH ~ Top 500 (1%) of players in North America (2016)\n  - COUNTER-STRIKE: GO ~ Supreme Master First Class (2.55%) of players in North America (2015)\n  - LEAGUE OF LEGENDS ~ Diamond 1 (0.10%) of players in North America (2014)\n\n# I like\n\n- Gaming\n- Coding\n- Design\n- Podcasts\n- Piano\n- Jazz and Classical Music\n- Working Out\n- Anime\n- Tennis\n- Animals\n\n# Timeline\n\n- I am a Korean-American who was born in Los Angeles but raised mostly in Orange County for 18 years.\n- In 2014 I graduated high school and enrolled at Pratt Institute based in Brooklyn, New York until 2018.\n- I spent 2018 attending a full-stack coding bootcamp at the University of California, Irvine.\n- In 2019 I had moved up to San Francisco and attended a full-stack coding bootcamp at the Rithm School.\n- I spent the latter half of 2019 attending an engineer internship and worked on a mobile application called My Home Pathway which utilized React Native.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- always finding inspiration.\n- enabling a brighter future.\n- always doing the best I can.\n",d=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(n){return n.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(n){return n.length})).length,h=function(n){var e=Object.assign({},n);return Object(a.jsx)(o.b,Object(t.a)({},e))};e.default=function(){return Object(a.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Jonathan Song",children:Object(a.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(a.jsx)("header",{children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(a.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(a.jsx)(o.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(a.jsx)(s.a,{source:c,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
