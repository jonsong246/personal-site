# Intro

I am currently an aspiring junior software developer with a strong background in design. I have graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Digital Arts 3D Animation from Pratt Institute in 2018. I have completed and received two full-stack coding bootcamp certificates from the University of California Irvine (UCI 2018) and the Rithm School based in San Francisco (2019).

# Currently

I am continuing my studies in software engineering in hopes of transitioning this passion into a professional environment with like-minded and driven individuals.

# Some history

- I've been introduced to technology at an early age and have been immersed in this field for as long as I can remember. It all started off with a few video games, all of which then paved my way into the Digital Realm. This led me towards exploring 3D Animation and eventually software engineering.
