# Intro

I am currently an aspiring junior software developer with a strong background in design. I have graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Digital Arts from Pratt Institute in 2018. I have completed and received two full-stack coding bootcamp certificates from the University of California Irvine (UCI 2018) and the Rithm School based in San Francisco (2019).

# Currently

I am always looking to expand on my skills and grow in engineering as well as design. I am actively looking for opportunities that will push me and allow me to contribute towards bigger projects with passionate and like-minded teammates.

# Some history

- I've been introduced to technology at an early age, all of which sparked my interest to everything digital. This led me towards exploring 3D Design as well as software engineering.
