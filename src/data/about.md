# Intro

I am currently an aspiring junior software developer with a strong background in design. I have graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Digital Arts 3D Animation from Pratt Institute in 2018. I have completed and received two full-stack coding bootcamp certificates from the University of California Irvine (UCI 2018) and the Rithm School based in San Francisco (2019).

# Currently

I am continuing my studies in software engineering in hopes of transitioning this passion into a professional environment with like-minded and driven individuals collaborating in projects of greater scale.

# Some history

- I've been introduced to technology at an early age and have been immersed in this field for as long as I can remember. It all started of with some video games like World of Warcraft, Counter-Strike, Starcraft, Diablo... etc. All of which paved my interests into the Digital Realm. Aside from a strong passion in gaming, this led me to explore visual design and eventually software engineering.


- A huge piece of my identity lies in competitive gaming. I've always held high standards in competition and have even taken time to pursue professional esports. While I have recently transitioned my focus towards ranking up in coding, I have several merits within gaming that showcase my time and dedication to the craft:


  - ROCKET LEAGUE ~ Grand Champ 1 (0.10%) of players in North America (2020)
  - VALORANT ~ Immortal 2 (0.4%) of players in North America (2019)
  - OVERWATCH ~ Top 500 (1%) of players in North America (2016)
  - COUNTER-STRIKE: GO ~ Supreme Master First Class (2.55%) of players in North America (2015)
  - LEAGUE OF LEGENDS ~ Diamond 1 (0.10%) of players in North America (2014)
